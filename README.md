# task-manager-plus
A Task Manager with extra features.
Made for someone who:
##
a) Hates themselves
##
b) Likes to use a knock-off of the windows Task Manager.
# Limits:
Doesn't work on Linux, MacOS and doesn't have any restrictions like normal Task Manager (e.g doesn't tell you to stop when you try and close down your system's driver or something XD).
